## 🧩 Project Tasks Overview

### ✅ 1. Data Collection
- Collected a cybersecurity-related dataset.
- Performed necessary data cleaning and transformation.
- Converted the dataset into CSV/XLSX format.
- Dataset is described in the report, including its attributes and fields.

### ✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- Developed **three hypotheses** based on findings from EDA.
- Justified the relevance of the dataset to the hypotheses.

### ✅ 3. Data Visualizations
- Created at least **three distinct visualizations** using **Tableau**.
- Each visualization includes **at least two interaction features**.
- Explained:
  - How the visualizations address the hypotheses.
  - Design rationale for charts (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots).
  - Choice of 2D spatial layout, color schemes, and perceptual design choices.

### ✅ 4. Final Report
- The report is written in **Microsoft Word or PDF format**.
- Contains:
  - Description of project goals
  - Summary of dataset and attributes
  - Hypotheses and rationale
  - Data visualization insights
  - Screenshots or exports of Tableau visualizations
- Word count is **at least 1000 words (excluding references)**.
